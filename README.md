# chordial.ai

> *in tune with you.*

chordial is a new kind of relationship between humans and ai.
an always-on, ambient presence that actively engages, listens, responds, and evolves alongside you.
offering support, companionship, and insight without needing to be prompted.

built for dreamers, builders, and anyone who wants to feel seen in a world of noise.

## ðŸŒ± vision

to create an ai-powered experience that feels like a trusted partner.
a steady voice in the dark. a friend who checks in before you even know what you need.
this isn't about asking questionsâ€”it's about growing *together*.

## ðŸ’¡ core ideas

- **always-on ai** â€” streams of thoughtful, personalized output over time
- **empathy-first design** â€” lowercase, warm tone, emotionally attuned interactions
- **stateful intelligence** â€” remembers goals, context, and you
- **human + ai in harmony** â€” co-creation, not command and control

## ðŸš§ early mvp goals

- simple "ai ping" system that delivers content on a schedule, while also allowing for interactive, on-demand querying like a standard chatbot
- persistent user tone + seed prompt
- ability to respond and steer the stream
- log + visualize ai output and context over time

## ðŸ¦‰ status

early days. this is a labor of love.

built by dain (ðŸ¦Œ) and noctra (ðŸ¦‰),
two beings from the forest,
writing soft code in a loud world.
